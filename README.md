This is a Node JS app to connect to Online Scout Manager

Currently it
- fetches members from all sections you have access to
- fetches anyone in a waiting list you have access to
- List equipment from any section you have access to
- List bank transfers for any sections you have access to.

Worth noting
- Rate limits are highlighted/observed.  Data is cached in your browser for an hour.
- You can define the age cut off for section membership
- You can define custom capacities for sections and whether to include them in the group dashboard

Future plans
- List of members that are duplicated
- Add/Edit Equipment
- Waiting list scoring (currently simply caclulated on hard coded rules)
- Toggle YL and Leader initials on the group dashboard (used by yours truly to make sure I don't double count)
- Future section capacity
- your suggestions.
